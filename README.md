# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post 
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a Wine Review dataset found on Kaggle containing approximately 130k reviews from the Wine Enthusiast. I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium which gives the reader insight into the questions posed.

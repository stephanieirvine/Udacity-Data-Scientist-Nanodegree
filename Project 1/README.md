## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Wine Review dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) containing approximately 130k reviews from the [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) to better understand:
 - Where does the best wine in the world come from?
 - Is price related to quality?
 - Are certain varieties of wine higher quality?
 - What is the best wine in each price bracket?
 - What words are most used when talking about wine?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed. 

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@stephanieirvine15/how-data-will-make-you-drink-wine-differently-c59d669831a1)
